### Botanical Description
Rumex crispus is a perennial that reaches a height of 4-5 feet. First-year plants form a basal rosette of leaves which gives way in the second year to a stalk bearing small, greenish, apetalous flowers in panicles. Lance-shaped, alternate leaves have distinctly curly margins. Grooved, angular stems are usually branched from the base up, with larger leaves at the bottom of the plant and smaller, thin, willowy leaves toward the top. The small seeds are enclosed by a winged, papery, heart-shaped husk. Both stalks and seeds turn a distinctive, rusty brown hue in the autumn and persist throughout the winter. Carrot-like taproots are typically between 8-12 inches long and have a relatively thick bark. The root bark is an orange-yellow color, while the root’s interior has a lighter, brighter yellow hue. Other Rumex species are often mistaken for R. crispus. Look for narrow leaves with very wavy margins and a pale green stem; another indicator is the yellow color of the roots. (2)


### In Practice 
Yellow dock is a particularly helpful plant for individuals with weak digestion, as it strengthens and tones the tissues of the digestive track, while improving their function, and increasing mineral nourishment to the tissue.  Loose bowel tone that coincides with constipation is a digestive condition that can be most effectively improved with yellow dock, particularly in decoction.  As an alterative, yellow dock simultaneously improves gut, liver, and gallbladder function, and provides iron, significantly improving the quality of the circulating fluids of the body. This is a helpful plant for those recovering from chronic gut inflammation and stagnation, which has backed up into the liver, slowing hepatic clearance (4)

### Indications
When there is too much pitta & too much kapha
“Bad Blood” system… when things become stagnant and then inflamed.
Affinity for digestive system used for:
- Dysentery and other gastrointestinal complaints
- Diarrhea
- Mild laxative (especially for the lower digestive tract)
- To help activate liver and gallbladder to aid in the digestion of fats & absorption of nutrients
- Cool digestive tract inflammation
- Cool mouth and stomach ulcers
- Heartburn
- Esophageal reflux
- Constipation with pregnancy
- Constipation that causes lower back pain
- Slow digestion and hemorrhoids
- Constipation due to prescription side effects
- Relief for people who have become dependent on over the counter laxatives (yellow dock itself is non-habit forming)
- For people who have had their gallbladder removed – (after healing) – this could be helpful for helping them to break down fats (4)


Affinity for skin conditions
- Chronic skin conditions: acne, boils, eczema, jaundice, and psoriasis
- burns, ulcerations, sores, scabs, rashes, diabetic ulcers, and hives
- Appalachian folk herbalists soak dock root in vinegar and apply as a wash on ringworm, rashes, and on animals in cases of mange or saddle sores
- folk remedy for nettle rash


Affinity for the respiratory system
- pulmonary hemorrhages
- Decoction for cough medicine
- catarrh, chronic sore throat, and tuberculosis
- dry and irritated cough, laryngitis, and bronchitis

Affinity for reproductive complaints
- hormonal imbalances related to liver congestion and poor fat digestion, such as fibrocystic breasts, uterine fibroids, and menstrual issues.
- premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, as well as menstrual headaches and acne
- excess stress hormones for those dealing with chronic pain from conditions such as fibromyalgia
**Blood Purifier & Blood Builder** 
- anemic or low in iron, chronically tired and stressed
- As it builds iron it also alleviates constipation  (where over the counter iron supplements can cause constipation) 

Chronic pain
- chronic pain, such as rheumatism, gout, and fibromyalgia

Kidney Issues
- kidney issues such as edema, stones, and the retention of urine

There is current research on it use for colorectal cancer


Pulse & Tongue indications (3)
- The pulse will be superficial, bounding and rapid
- A yellow coating on the tongue


### Contraindications
- Large doses, especially of the fresh root, may cause gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and diarrhea. Yellow dock is most beneficial in sub-laxative doses
- the oxalic acid in yellow dock can aggravate rheumatism and gout
- Do not use with kidney disease
- Can activate Vatta – stimulating, drying(3)
- Diabetes due to its diuretic action (3)
- Caution with Kidney stones & gout (3)
- Though traditional used with pregnancy, there are contraindications, and should be used cautiously (3)

#### Herb-Drug Interactions: 
Possible interference with any drug as it impairs absorption if taken at the same time. Also avoid with any accompanying medication that causes hypokalemia (low level of potassium in the blood serum), cardiac glycosides, anti-arrhythmics, and diuretics. (3)


### Methods of Preparation & Dosing
parts used: Root, young leaf, seed
recommend using yellow dock moderately and for short-term periods, such as 2-3 weeks at most 
- Tincture: 30-75 drops fresh root (1:2, 50%) or dried root (1:5, 50%) 3x/day
- Decoction: 6-12g dried root/day divided into 1 to 3 doses    
- Capsule: 1-2 #00 capsules 1-2x/day (3)    
- Poultices or ointment    
- As a food (seeds as flour, leaves used like spinach, or roots in soups)

> [!NOTE] According to Katja & Ryn
> For constipation… tinctures are used to help move the bile and cause the rhythmic contractions to move stuff out.  For diarrhea, decoctions are the best method to get the astringent use. Vinegars are the best to get the minerals for use with iron deficiency. (So the way the herb is formulated is important to the need)


## Ancestry
_Understanding a plant is about learning it’s history. Where did it come from? Who walked with it and how did they use it? Did the plant travel from it’s home land and how did it travel, what people moved it? 

### Native habitat
Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.

### Where can it be found now
Yellow dock is widespread and naturalized in many parts of the world. It is found throughout Asia, Europe, North and South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and North America including all fifty of the United States. It is considered one of the five most widely distributed plants in the world and is listed as an invasive species in some regions

### Historical Use
Bitter, astringent roots support healthy digestive function, relieve lymphatic congestion and strengthen the bowels.

It tones and cools the digestive tract and relieves sluggish digestion characterized by difficulty digesting fats, acid reflux, intestinal inflammation, and food allergies. It supports lymphatic circulation, purifies the blood, and relieves liver congestion to heal chronic cases of acne, eczema and other skin eruptions. Use it to tone weak bowels that lead to diarrhea with loose but difficult to evacuate stools or in higher doses to relieve constipation. 

Once the plant spread into North America after the arrival of colonists, many Native American tribes, such as the Cherokee, Delaware, and Iroquois, also employed yellow dock for gastrointestinal complaints, such as diarrhea and dysentery. American pioneers drank a decoction of yellow dock root as a tonic, digestive aid, and slight laxative. The Eclectics also used Rumex for digestive issues such as stomach ulcers and diarrhea. King’s American Dispensatory specifically recommends small doses of Rumex in cases of nervous dyspepsia with gas and darting pain in the left chest.  Historically, used for scurvy because of the high Vitamin C content and to ease anemia due to its high iron content and its ability to promote the absorption of iron.  Mathew Wood used to relieve a severe case of ulcerative colitis – removing the need for surgery

## As a food
As a food… yellow dock leaves are often used in place for spinach. Seeds are ground into flour. Roots are added to soups. > Susun Weed (1989) includes it in her “spring tonic soup” recipe, which also contains burdock root, dandelion greens and root, and seaweed 

### Vitamins
Yellow dock is high in a variety of vitamins and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and vitamin A

### Spiritual
Linked to our emotions “gut feelings”. Can help us let go of the feelings that are blocking our progress, impeding our understanding, or weighing us down. “calling for yellow dock as “excess badger energy,” which means “too much fire in the stomach and digestive tract, too much appetite, too much emotional energy”. When there is too much anger. Helps to release us from old patterns we hold on too. Yellow dock can counter the choleric tendency of our modern world. 

When the colin gets stagnant, the mind also gets stagnant – and yellow dock can help get this moving (3)

## Compare / Contrast
_Sometimes it’s easier to understand a plant when you compare and contrast it with another. The could be two plants that are naturally used together, or two plants that could be substitute for one another, etc. You may choose to tell this a study or a story._

- [ ] Compare this with maybe another digestive bitter... like sienna that's pretty harsh

## Stewardship
_Developing a true relationship with a plant is about becoming a steward. It’s about recognizing your responsibility for this plant and the other lives that live in relationship to it. Remember that this species was here before you, and with proper care, will be here after you. It is your ancestor._

### Gardening
	Thrives in USDA Zone 3-9. It has a long tap root, so grow in ground or 12 inch deep pot. Doesn’t easily transport, so grow from seed… sprinkle seeds on the surface – sunny to partial sunny. Keep moist while getting established. After, yellow doc can take care of itself. Spreads fast, so pinch off flowers before allowing to seed for more control.
### Wildcrafting
Yellow dock preferes open sites with wet, nutrient-rich oil. Find it in meadows, gardens, waste areas, and along roadsides and ditches from low to middle elevations.

Dig the roots from early to late autumn. Thicker, darker color roots make the most potent medicine. Cut the roots width-wise into ¼ -inch sections and dry on screens (1)

#### Recipes from Evolutionary Herbalism

**Syrup for Purifying the Blood**
- 4 oz Yellow Dock Root
- 4 oz Dandelion Root

Boil in one gallon of water; strain and add one pint of Holland gin. 
Dose, a wine-glassful once a day.


**Iron rich syrup**
- 3 tbs Nettle leaf
- 1 tbs Yellow Dock Root
- 1 tbs Dandelion Root
- 1 tbs Burdock Root
- 1 tbs Astragalus
- 2 tbs Rosehips
- 8 cups water
- 1 cup Molasses

1. Add Yellow Dock, Dandelion, Burdock, Astragalus, Rose hips, and water to a pot.
2. Heat on low and simmer the herbs for 30 minutes to an hour, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Don’t let the pot come to a rolling boil, but keep it simmering.
3. Turn the heat off and add your Nettle and steep for 30 minutes.
4. Strain, then stir in molasses. Let your syrup cool and bottle it up.

  

**Blood Building Formula** 
- 15-25% Yellow Dock (Rumex crispus)
- 15-25% Nettle leaf (Urtica spp.)
- 15-25% Alfalfa (Medicago sativa)
- 15-25% Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon citratus)
- 15-25% Dandelion Leaf (Taraxacum officinalis)

This is an apple cider vinegar tincture that includes sources of iron from plants and helps to increase absorption.
Generally vinegar is a preferable menstruum for mineral rich plants as it specifically draws out minerals very effectively. This one comes from Sharol Tilgner and is indicated for those with iron deficiency anemia or poor absorption of iron.


**Dandelion-Yellow Dock Syrup**
- ½ ounce Yellow dock root (Rumex crispus)
- ½ ounce Dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale)
- ½ cup Molasses
This formula is similar as above as it will support iron deficiency anemia and mild constipation, just a simpler pair and classically used for expecting mothers from Dr.
Aviva Romm. 
1. Prepare a decoction by simmering both herbs equaling 1 oz (28 g) totalin 4 cups of water, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup. 
2. Strain the liquid thoroughly and add ½ cup blackstrap molasses, mixing until blended. 
3. Cool to room temperature and store in the refrigerator. 
 
The product will keep for up to 2 weeks.

Dose: 1 to 2 tbsp, up to twice daily depending upon the severity of the anemia.

**Detox Symmetry**
- 20%  Burdock (Arctium lappa)
- 20%  Red Root _(Ceanothus americanus)_
- 20%  Yellow Dock _(Rumex crispus)_
- 15%  Red Clover _(Trifolium pratense)_
- 10%  Nettle leaf _(Urtica spp.)_
- 10%  Echinacea _(Echinacea angustifolia)_
- 5%  Sassafras _(Sassafras albidum)_

This formula is for chronic skin conditions, lymphatic swellings, liver stagnation, damp/heat. Best for _kapha_ and _pitta_ constitutions, contraindicated in excess _vata_. We want to see **excess** accumulation here, not to be used in deficient people.

**Liver Glycerite**
- 10-25% Dandelion root _(Taraxacum officinalis)_
- 10-25% Oregon grape Root _(Mahona spp.)_
- 10-25% Yellow dock _(Rumex crispus/obtusifolius)_
- 10-25% Milk Thistle _(Silybum marianum)_
- 10-25% Burdock _(Arctium lappa)_
This formula from Sharol Tilgner is used as a liver and gallbladder tonic and restorative. It helps to protect and regenerate hepatocytes, liver cells, and stimulates the liver and gall bladder. It also helps to stimulate digestion. This is a good formula to use when there’s sluggishness, chronic constipation, poor digestion of lipids, jaundice from liver dysfunction and also post surgical removal of gallbladder. As it is a pretty drying bitter formula, preparing it as a glycerite softens that a bit with the demulcent nature of glycerin.

**Skin Formula**
- 30-45% Burdock _(Arctium lappa)_
- 20-30% Oregon Grape root _(Mahonia spp.)_
- 10-20% Sarsaparilla _(Smilax ornata)_
- 10-20% Yellow Dock _(Rumex crispus)_
- 5-15% Nettle _(Urtica spp.)_
- 5-15% Horsetail _(Equisetum spp.)_
Here we have another formula from Sharol Tilgner with an internal remedy for the skin. There’s a combination of alteratives, inflammatory modulating, immunopotentiators, and gastrointestinal aids. This helps to increase the movement and activity of the organs in the body that are responsible for the assimilation of nutrients and that help eliminate waste, which affect the skin. It’s primarily focused on the liver (Burdock, Oregon Grape, Yellow Dock), urinary tract (Nettle, Horsetail), and blood (all). It’s also quite mineral rich (Horsetail, Nettle, Yellow Dock). This formula can be used for a variety of skin conditions such as eczema, acne, psoriasis and dandruff.

**Hormonal Acne Formula**
- 20% Yellow Dock _(Rumex crispus)_
- 20% Sarsaparilla _(Smilax ornata)_
- 20% Burdock _(Arctium lappa)_
- 20% Echinacea _(Echinacea angustifolia)_
- 20% Wild Lettuce (_Lactuca virosa_)

This formula can be utilized in the same way as above, for skin eruptions caused from internal toxicity but may prove to be serviceable for post adolescent acne related to a 
woman's menstrual cycle. The one herb in here that is likely to be a bit of a surprise is 
Wild Lettuce. Usually considered a hypnotic nervine and anodyne, Wild Lettuce, 
being a quite strong bitter, is also a notable liver remedy. Matthew Wood teaches that it is specific for states of androgen excess (ie testosterone) and the strain its excess can place on the liver, both of which can lead to acne. High androgens tend to also lead to 
overstimulation, aggression, and irritability, which can accompany hormonal related acne.

**Skin/Wound Wash**
- 1 part Yellow Dock _(Rumex crispus)_
- 1 part Yarrow _(Achillea mallefolium)_
- 1 part Calendula _(Calendula off.)_

Externally this wash can be prepared as tea, first decocting the roots of Yellow dock
anywhere from 20 - 45 mins, then steeping the Yarrow and Calendula for about 30 
minutes (taking the preparation off the heat), strain well and cool enough to wash or
soak the affected area of skin. You can either use this as a fomentation, soak, or wound
wash for skin infections, poorly healed abrasions, boils, heat rashes, lingering poison
ivy/oak rashes, Nettle stings and bug bites.

**Bitters Blend**
- 25% Yellow Dock _(Rumex crispus)_
- 20% Blessed Thistle (_Cnicus benedictus)_
- 20% Dandelion root _(Taraxacum officinalis)_
- 15% Gentian _(Gentiana lutea)_
- 10% Ginger _(Zingiber officinale)_
- 10% Fennel _(Foeniculum vulgare)_

This bitters blend can be taken 10 - 15 minutes before meals to help stimulate the digestive juices throughout the GI, prepping the stomach for a meal it's about to digest, making it easier to assimilate and digest. The bitters' in this formula are specifically Yellow Dock, Blessed Thistle, Dandelion, and Gentian (being the most bitter), which are all very cooling and drying remedies, so it's balanced off with the warming carminatives of Ginger and Fennel. It can also help with post digestive bloating, helping to alleviate any discomforts after heavy meals or overindulgence of food.

**Scudder’s Alterative Formula**
- Corydalis tubers _(Dicentra canadensis)_
- Black Alder bark _(Alnus serrulata)_
- Mayapple root _(Podophyllum peltatum)_
- Figwort flowering herb _(Scrophularia nodosa)_
- Yellow Dock root _(Rumex crispus)_

This formula doesn't come with parts or %'s and comes from Dr. John Milton Scudder
who was a 19th-century physician and practitioner of eclectic medicine. This formula could be used as a general alterative formula to help clean the blood and lymph, but he used this to help reduce uterine fibroids or slow their growth as prescribed based on anecdotal reports of modest success reducing size and number of fibroids.

Dose: 30 to 40 drops in a small amount of warm water three times a day.
