There are a lot of things I want to learn. In order to fit it in and still have life balance, I should have a plan. A flexible plan. The idea here is to look at what my ideal day / week would look like -- and then be flexible to the bends and shifts of time an opportunity.

This plan should be re-addressed quarterly to bend and shift with the rhythms of the Sun. 

Ideal study week
Wed - 3 hours (3 to 6) - witchy education
Thurs - SV III ... and some weeks W&B Knights
Sat - 3 hours am - witchy education
Sun - 3 hours am - optional topic -- but educational
Reading through out the week

Ideal day (weekday)
start day - wash up | alter time | breakfast (take nugget to camp)
work -- with 2 to 3 fly ladies build into breaks
personal time - walk nugget (if he's home)-(pick up nugget)
evening routine - make dinner / go out and socialize / tv / gaming
bed time -- shower or bath | light reading | sleep by 9:30 -10

*personal time*:
- exercise, appointments, lab time
- on wednesday -- personal time = study time
- business | hobbies

Ideal day (weekend)
start day gradually -- studies, breakfast
flex time
evening routine - make dinner / go out and socialize / tv / gaming
bed time -- shower or bath | light reading | sleep by 9:30 -10

*flex time*
- social
- gardening
- chores

1x week plan weekly schedule ( check in end of day)
2x a month manage budgets
- claims, sassy receipts, budgets, bills
1x month - plan monthly goals
1x quarter - plan quarter goals
