### Gardening
The rhizomes of cultivated wild yam plants are traditionally harvested in the fall, after the plant has fixed its primary and secondary constituents for winter dormancy (Cech, 2002). These roots tend to remain relatively close to the surface of the soil and can run for extensive lengths. Harvest wild yam from the base of the vine outwards, leaving the end portions of the rhizome in the ground; this is where future growth takes place, and this will allow the plant to continue to survive after harvest (Cech, 2002). The rhizome should be chopped into small slices and dried using a dehydrator, as they are very prone to molding during the drying process. Fresh wild yam roots have, on average, 64% water content (Cech, 2000) and should be dried to 10% moisture content (Müller & Heindl, 2007). Store dried roots or root pieces in sealed glass jars away from light. Properly stored dried rhizomes of wild yam will retain potency for 1 year (Felter & Lloyd, 1898). A tincture can also be made after drying to prolong storage; be sure to macerate tincture for at least 5 weeks, shaking daily, as the roots are tough and slow to give up their herbal virtues (Cech, 2002). Roots collected in autumn are superior in potency to those collected in the spring
