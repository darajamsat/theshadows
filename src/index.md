I'm Dara Pressley. An herbalist, a witch, an autodidact and life long student. And I want to welcome you to my Shadow Garden. This is a space where I am "learning  in public". Unlike a blog that claims to be polished writing from a perspective of mastery of subject material, this space is about allowing my notes, my thoughts, my concepts, to be seen in public as I create them. At it's core, nothing here is ever finished as there are deeper levels I can get into -- or reimagine/revision concepts. 

## Shadow Garden
A space to ponder on the esoteric nature of our world. Topics range from herbalism, to tarot and astrology, to spirituality, and what ever else comes. ^109d69

### PKM + Learning in Public
Often the term used for this type of system is PKM[^2] or personal knowledge management. In the past, my note where all over the place... typed up in digital apps like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), hand drawn in digital apps like [Pen Book](https://penbook.app/) or [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/), in paper journals, on scraps of paper pulled from the printer, stickies... in other words what ever was most convenient at the time. In general, the system worked because I had a pretty good memory for where the notes were and could find and review as needed.

Recently, however, for my level 2 apprenticeship with Sacred Vibes Apothecary, I was required to keep a journal of my reflections, formulas, and about my plant walk. I still took my notes in the usual manor, but as I assembled them in the journal I made a couple of revelations.

First, I wasn't just copying my notes in, I was refactoring them as I went. Often, there was a lag between the first creation of the note and when I added it to my journal, so I had more information from classes and materials I was referencing. More than just extending the knowledge gained, I had deeper reactions or those "aha" moments when concepts came together. These notes were very much improved over the originals in their over all content.

Second, because I was writing this for an audience, It forced me to complete my thoughts in ways I would not have if they were just notes for myself. I couldn't just put a random bullet point, I needed to explain or, in other words, show my work.

## So why this is here
I wanted to keep that experience going. Even if no one is reading this... even if I'm just throwing my work to the void... Creating this space to speak to an imagined audience, I believe is this missing piece in curating... and therefore creating deeper understanding of the material I'm learning.

## You're actually here!!
So you've found me. You're reading this material and you have something to add. That's awesome! Collaboration is what makes learning most fun. I invite you to add your comment as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/darajamsat/theshadows/issues). This will give me a chance to read your message and respond. 

### Other people have been here!!!
Feel free to browse those [issues](https://github.com/darajamsat/theshadows/issues) to see what others have added and enhance the conversation. But please, remember to be kind to each other. 

## Process for publishing
Of course, to carry this off, I needed to be able to easily keep my notes and publish in one shot. I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create and maintain my notes. And a self-built site generator using 11ty, called [Brownstones](https://github.com/darajamsat/brownstones)[^1].  With this set up I can literally publish my thoughts with a hotkey -- a save as a publish!  If you are interested in doing something like this for yourself. Watch that link. Coming soon, I will have some information/videos, on how to set this up. Even if you don't know anything about development -- it is easy to do.


[^1]: In the tradition of naming Static Site Generators after books, Browstones is named after the book, [[brown-girl-brownstones|Brown Girl Brownstones]] By Paule Marshall one of my favorite writers.
