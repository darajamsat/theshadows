### Gardening
To harvest roots and rhizomes, it is best to do so in the spring or autumn, after 3-4 years of growth. For small-scale production, a simple method is to dig trenches 23-35 inches (60-90 cm) deep with a garden spade. Once harvested, the roots should be washed to remove dirt and can be left whole, cut to the desired length, or put through a chaff cutter, and then carefully spread onto drying screens and dried at 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Alternatively, the roots can be sliced and dried in sunlight
